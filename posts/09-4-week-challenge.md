# I'm starting a 4 week challenge

I will launch 10 SaaS products in 4 weeks starting today. The products will:
- Be limited in scope but work really well within it.
- Have a free tier and be significantly cheaper than competitors.
- Be open source

## Why now?

I've worked a lot in the past 8 weeks, and built 4+ products I use often, yet I launched 0 publicly. One of those products is Kamara, an AI code editor that made me really fast at building other software. I believe I can use Kamara and a template I've built recently to spin up fully working SaaS extremely fast. 

Many SaaS today have 80%+ margins, yet building software is faster and easier than ever. I will build competitors to common popular tools in the market, build the core features and sell them a lot cheaper than existing competitors.

Yet building is not the whole story. The challenge is to launch, not to build. Unfortunately, I have a bias against launching for some reason and I want to change that, I want to be launching several times a week.

## Why Open Source?

I've used a lot of Open Source software over the years, I took and took and almost never gave back. This will be my way of giving back.

## How much marketing will go into each launch?

Not a lot at first. I don't have post-launch goals, I just want to get into the habit of launching products. I will launch in HN, PH and a few SaaS directories and leave it alone for a bit while I build the rest of the products. Obviously I'll monitor the launches and support any customers that come in, but I will focus more on marketing after the challenge, once I have all the 10 products built. Unless one of them really blows up I guess.

What's the worst that can happen? I build 10 useful tools that I can use in the future and nobody else uses them. I'm fine with that.

## I know this is a bad idea

This is not the objectively best way to do things, but I need to change things up. I just re-read [@levelsio](https://x.com/levelsio) 12 startups in 12 months post https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/ and I found I'm thinking a lot of the same things he was at the time.
