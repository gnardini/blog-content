# I never finished the challenge

I realized I was wasting my time. I was building too small barely functional MVPs, and not doing anything for distribution, which made no sense. I knew this was not a good idea from the beginning, but like I said in my [introduction post](https://gnardini.com/blog/im-starting-a-10-startups-in-4-weeks-challenge) I just wanted to do it anyways.

I've always had trouble working hard for very long. I can work hard for short periods of time but I can never make it last. I'm trying to be more mindful of what helps me keep going or stop. It's usually motivation-related, but relying only on motivation is really unstable. I'd love to be able to force myself into working more easily. The laziness helps sometimes to not work on useless things, but it sometimes goes overboard and prevents moving at all. 

My last post was over 2 months ago, which is when I stopped working as hard, especially after mid-october. Since then I spent around a month and a half doing very little work. I'm picking back up now and I'd really like to be more consistent this time. Last big productivity wave lasted 3 months, July - September. I'd like for this one to last longer and for that I think I need to be more mindful of what works and what doesn't to keep myself moving.

## Pathways

I'm working on [Pathways](https://mypathways.com/) now. I never talked about Pathways “publicly” before but it's a startup I'm building with a partner. It's the only one I'm not doing completely solo, and I don't know why I haven't talked about it yet. We started around a year ago and have had very limited success so far.

Pathways is an LMS - Learning Management System. It's a tool for universities or other education-related institutions to communicate with students, share material with them, upload grades and other education-related tasks. It's a very big market and there's a lot of competition, both good signs. We have a unique take on content management and platform friendliness and I think we have a good shot at success here. If we work hard enough.

We recently hired an “Account Manager”, which means a sales guy that is reaching out to many potential customers and setting up meetings with them. We saw the traffic on our website grow significantly since and have had promising talks with several clients but no deals yet. It's a big decision for any institution or educator to pick an LMS, it's the most important piece of software they need to do their job so it's usually a lengthy process but we're optimistic.

A mistake I've made so far is to think that since I've partnered with someone else I can just focus on tech and product and let him handle everything else. I think I have to be more involved with getting customers at this stage, and I think focusing on getting it to work in other countries (payments only work in Argentina for now) and SEO are the most important things I can do right now.

At some point I'd like to start posting on X again. I'm not sure why or what about, I just feel like it's something I should do. It's hard to get noticed, especially because the content I write is not viral-y enough, but I think typing in public is useful sometimes, even if nobody reads it. Like this post.

If you're reading this, please get in touch! I'm writing this on a blog which very few people know about and certainly close to zero people read. I personally don't know anybody that reads it, so I'd love to talk to you if you do. [Send me a DM on X](https://x.com/gonza_nardini).
