The challenge was 10 apps in 4 weeks so I'm 1 app behind right now, but I'm hopeful I can pick up pace in the next two weeks, I need to do 3 apps per week the next two weeks.

These two weeks I realized even more how silly what I'm doing is. I have to build apps in like 2 days each, so each one has only very basic features and I can't do much follow up.

I still think it's a fun thing to do. I'm building a lot of utility kind of SaaS apps that will be useful in the future, while building a portfolio of open source apps. I'm actually using these apps for myself, so they are ading value to me personally if nothing else.

None of them have any paying customers yet, which is understandable since I didn't do any big marketing push and their landing pages are not great if I'm being honest. The bright side is that I will have a varied list of apps to try out and test different copy and marketing strategies in two weeks.

I'm thinking quite a bit about what I'll do after the 4 weeks are up. The one thing I know is that I'll have to pick one of them and focus marketing on it for a bit, maybe polish it up a bit, make a bigger effort on the landing page, etc. I'm doing breath now, I need to do depth after.

One thing I noticed too is that I think I enjoy B2C over B2B. I care more about people that companies. The general wisdom is that B2C is harder and I really don't want to do the harder thing before I can even succeed at the easier one but I do find it more interesting and difficulty is always relative anyways.

This week I'll build a support chat kind of thing, like Crisp/Intercom, a feature request tool like Canny (I will integrate these two into at least one of my existing apps) and a sports-based app. 

I follow lots of sports so I want a tool that allows me to track how my favorite teams/players do in different ones and have a clean UI where I can follow past performance and future games. For this week I'll start with just one sport, haven't decided which yet. I also need to do some research to know what exists already similar to this, I'm sure something exists, even if it's not exactly what I want.
